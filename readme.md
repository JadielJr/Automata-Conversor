# Automata Conversor

A tool that converts [Nondeterministic Finite Automaton with ε-moves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton) to simple NFA.  
Built In pure C language.

## Getting Started

1. Place the .exe file in an empty folder.
2. Place a input .txt file in the same folder.
3. Run the .exe file and insert the name of the input file you want to convert.
4. The program will generate a output .txt file that is similar to input file, but it is a text representation of your NFA-ε converted to simple NFA.
